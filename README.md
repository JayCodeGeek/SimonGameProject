# SimonGameProject

Inorder to learn about jQuery and to implement it, I've created this project.
This project is about simon game, In which user has to select right sequence of colors.
In this project i've learned how to get and set css, addClass, removeClass and so on.
I also got to know about event listeners and how to add them.
